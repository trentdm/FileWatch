A couple of things I noted during the implementation of this project. 
In a real world setting, would seek clarification or confirmation on these items before final implementation.

Spec seemed to indicate a single directory being monitored, and not recursively monitoring, could confirm.
Spec seemed to indicate that file name, not full path is to be written out on create/modify, could confirm.
Handling of renaming files wasn't specifically mentioned, but treating as a delete/create event. Should clarify.
Spec mentions that file names are case insensitive, code currently doesn't notify on case change. Should clarify.
Case for handling the event of a modification, but no line count change wasn't entirely clear in instruction #6. 
	Decided to output +{lineCount} just so it would be distinguishable from a creation that is just {lineCount}.
Not entirely clear on whether program should report on current state of directory when first ran, spec seems to leave
	it open, so currently writing out linecount on initial run, but can change easily. Should clarify.
